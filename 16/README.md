 DEADLINE: March 25, 2017

    (BINARY TREE/MATHEMATICAL TREE Assignment) 
    Write a Java program that accepts as input a mathematical expression in string form. It constructs the mathematical expression tree 
    of the input mathematical expression. It does Depth-first Search traversal on the constructed mathematical expression tree in order 
    to determine the numeric value of the input mathematical expression. Output the value of the root or the value of the input
    mathematical expression. Use the Java class MathTreeNode that follows.

    public class MathTreeNode
    {
      char  label;
      float value;
      MathTreeNode left, right; // pointers to the left and right operands(children nodes)
      .
      .
      .

    }
